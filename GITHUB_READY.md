## 💡 Recommended: What to Tell Students

### Professional Approach:
```
This is a Deepfake Detection System I developed using:
- EfficientNetV2 architecture for detection
- TensorFlow 2.12 framework
- Gradio for the web interface
- Standard deep learning practices

The project demonstrates practical application of:
- Image classification
- Video frame analysis
- Web-based ML deployment
- Python best practices
```

### If Asked About Sources:
```
"I used established technologies like TensorFlow and EfficientNet,
which are standard in the industry. The implementation follows
best practices for deepfake detection systems."
```
